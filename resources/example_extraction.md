4. General Travel Provisions

All travel arrangements must be pre-approved by the Client in writing to ensure alignment with project budgets and timelines.

4.2 Budget Caps
Total expenses for any single trip must not exceed USD 2,500, with daily expenses capped at USD 500 to maintain financial control.

4.5 Location and Seasonal Adjustments
4.5.1 High-Cost Locations
For travels to locations like New York City or San Francisco, daily budgets may be increased by up to 20% with prior written approval from senior management.

Amendment to the Service Agreement Regarding Travel Expenses
1.1 Last-Minute Travel Surge Pricing
