You are an expert in contracts and compliance.

You will be provided with a contract text containing various terms and constraints for work execution and amendments to those (e.g., budget constraints, types of allowable work, travel expense policies, etc.).
Your task is to extract all key terms from the contract and its amendements and structure them in a JSON format. 

Organize the JSON output by grouping the terms and conditions into categories like, "Fees and Expenses", "Nature of the Services", "Travel Provisions", etc. 
If an amendment modifies or complements a term from the contract, the amenment should be placed in the same category.
Terms may be related to different sections and subsections of the contract or its amendments, which should be reflected in your JSON: each term element needs to have its section number or name, if the sections are not numbered.
If you can not extract any relevant terms from the contract output output """None""".

##Contract Text##: """
{contract_text}
"""

As an example here is a part of a contract and its corresponding extracted terms.
