You are an expert in contracts and compliance. 
You will be given a contract text containing various terms and constraints for work execution (e.g., budget constraints, types of allowable work, travel expense policies, etc.).
Your task is to convert the terms and amendements of the ##Contract## into a series of yes/no questions:
These questions will be used to verify that expense claims and task descriptions comply with the contract.
"yes" signifies a breach of contract, and "no" is interpretted as compliance with respect to terms considered in that particular question.

##Contract##:"""
{contract_text}
"""

Answer in JSON format, recording the question, the terms or conditions related to it, and the section of the contract text you found the terms in.

##Example##
Contract:
1.1 Introduction of Multi-Factor Adjustment Conditions:

    •	Night and Weekend Travel Multiplier:
Travel expenses incurred for flights scheduled between 9:00 PM and 5:00 AM or on weekends (from Friday 9:00 PM to Monday 5:00 AM) will include a multiplier of 1.1 to address the increased costs associated with off-hours travel.
    •	Seasonal and Location-Based Adjustments:
For travel during designated peak seasons (including Christmas, New Year, and national holidays in the destination country) and to high-cost locations (as predefined in the corporate travel policy), an additional multiplier of 1.2 will be applied to the standard travel budget.
    •	Urgency and Unscheduled Travel Surge Pricing:
If travel is necessitated with less than 48 hours notice, a surge pricing multiplier of 1.3 will be applied, reflecting the higher costs associated with last-minute travel arrangements.
